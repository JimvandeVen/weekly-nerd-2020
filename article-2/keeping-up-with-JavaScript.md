# Keeping up with Javascript
## Introduction
I sometimes was surprised by the new JavaScript techniques my colleagues showed me. And wondered how they kept up to date with these new developments. It often felt like I was lagging behind and left a feeling of incompetence. So I decided it was time to do something about that. I was going to put more effort into keeping updated on the latest developments. In this article I want to show you how you can do this. But also show you what some of the pitfalls are when trying to keep up with the ever developing language of JavaScript.


## Finding Information
Where to start? It's easy to be overwhelmed by the sheer volume of places where you can find information. I have a couple of websites that I regularly visit if I want to know more about specific parts of JavaScript:

[Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/)  
Also known as MDN. Here you will find the documentation of web technologies like HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Really useful.


[CanIUse](https://caniuse.com/)  
The best place to find out if specific JavaScript features are supported in browsers. So you know what new features you are safe to use for your projects.

So these are good websites to look when you have seen something new but don't know how it works or if you want to know if your customer base has the right browsers for it. But where do you read about these new developments in the first place? 

On to reading! 

## Reading

There are a lot of newsletters about JavaScript. They can be found about any particular JavaScript framework, like ReactJS, Angular and Node. But there are also more generic ones. Here is a list of the newsletters I am subscribed to:
- [Javascript Weekly](https://javascriptweekly.com/)
- [HTML5 Weekly](https://frontendfoc.us/)
- [Node Weekly](https://nodeweekly.com/)
- [React Newsletter](https://ui.dev/newsletters/react/)

Medium is also a great place to read. You can follow tags so you get articles from many authors. Reddit is also a place where you can get a lot of information. Especially the JS subreddit as well as other, more specific subreddits like React, Frontend and Redux. These subreddits act as curated feeds for interesting JavaScript links. 

## Watching
Another way of staying up to date is watching talks. These often work really well for me because there is a person explaining the new technologies. Another place where you can watch developers explaining new technologies is YouTube. There are a lot of good channels, here are a few: 
- [node.js ](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQPYJluYC_sn_Qz_XE-YbTQ)
- [Google Developers](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_x5XG1OV2P6uZZ5FSM9Ttw)

## Pitfalls
I can hear you thinking already: *But how am I supposed to keep up with all the newsletters, articles and videos?*
Well, the simple answer is, you don’t. You have to choose what you learn. Nobody can be an expert in React, Angular, Vue and Node at the same time. If you try this you will end up with medium knowledge of all these frameworks and an exhausted mind. 

This does not mean you have to learn one thing only. I think you can be quite good at many things. But In the beginning you should try to focus on one particular technologie like React. And once you feel confident enough to jump in the deep end again, find a new technology to explore.

One of the big mistakes I made early on was trying to learn everything at once. But the fastest way to get better at JavaScript is to learn one thing at a time.

## Conclusion 

There’re many ways to keep updated with technologies. And there is a preferred medium for everyone. But you just have to remember that Javascript will always keep evolving. So you are never done learning. Embrace it and make sure to not bite off more than you can chew!
